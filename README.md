How to use find, file, and conditionals in Bash

Working with arrays to group file types

file_ops.sh
mv, rm, read with user input

Interactive scripting with case

search_text.sh
Using grep with find

Understanding search in large file systems

compare_files.sh
Hashing with sha256sum

Understanding binary vs text comparison

main.sh
Menu-based CLI with case and while

Linking multiple scripts for modularity

🛠️ Requirements
Linux environment (or VirtualBox/WSL)

Bash

Edit
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
📘 Future Work
Create a GUI version using Python + Tkinter

Log every operation with timestamps

Unit tests with bats or custom checks

Add error handling (e.g., invalid paths)
